                        When I was in junior high school, I was always chosen to be a member of PASKIBRA at my school. In addition, this is one of my experiences as a flag-raising troop when my school had a guest from the Accreditation team. Here, I am tasked with taking our country's flag before it is hoisted.

                        I took my high school education at a new school, Unity School. My class is the fifth batch of this high school and next to this is a photo of me and the other student council members. We are the first batch to successfully hold an annual event for our school, namely AHUREI. Before the pandemic got worse, we managed to hold AHUREI offline at our school. We invited 13 schools and held 8 competitions.
